# Component Documentation: MorganStanleyFinancialAdvisorsScraper

## 1. Component Name
MorganStanleyFinancialAdvisorsScraper

## 2. Description
The MorganStanleyFinancialAdvisorsScraper component is a Yeager Workflow component designed to scrape financial advisors' information from a given base URL and save the data to a Google Sheet. It is based on the AbstractWorkflow class.

## 3. Input and Output Models
### Input Model: ScraperInput
- **base_url (str):** The base URL from which the scraper will extract financial advisors' information.

### Output Model: GoogleSheetOutput
- **sheet_url (str):** The URL of the Google Sheet where the scraped information is saved.

Both input and output models use Pydantic's BaseModel for validation and serialization.

## 4. Parameters
There is no specific parameter in the MorganStanleyFinancialAdvisorsScraper class, only the required `args` and `callbacks` parameters inherited from the AbstractWorkflow class.

### Inherited Parameters from AbstractWorkflow:
- **args (ScraperInput):** The input data required by the transform method. Contains the base URL.
- **callbacks (typing.Any):** An optional parameter for callbacks, which can be left as None. 

## 5. Transform Function
The transform() method is implemented asynchronously in the following steps:

1. Call the superclass transform method with the given `args` and `callbacks`. Receive the results as a dictionary.
2. Extract the `sheet_url` from the dictionary.
3. Create a new instance of the GoogleSheetOutput model with the extracted `sheet_url`.
4. Return the GoogleSheetOutput model as the results of the transform() method.

## 6. External Dependencies
- **dotenv**: Used to load environment variables from a `.env` file if available.
- **fastapi**: Used for creating a FastAPI instance for the component's web service.
- **pydantic**: Used to create and validate input and output data models.

## 7. API Calls
There are no specific external API calls made by the MorganStanleyFinancialAdvisorsScraper component itself. However, the data is saved in a Google Sheet, which incorporates API calls to the Google Sheets API.

## 8. Error Handling
The component handles errors through FastAPI and Pydantic's built-in error handling mechanisms, like validation errors for input data. Any errors encountered during the transform method execution will be raised and caught by the underlying FastAPI framework.

## 9. Examples
